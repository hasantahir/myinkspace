Small Font
==========

This is a small font for use in machine embroidery.  It includes capital and lowercase letters, numbers, and the following punctuation: `< > = - + , : ( ) @ . _ ' " “ ”#`

Currently one size is available, 0.2 inches, as measured by the width of the capital letter "M".

You may use this font for free in any embroidery project, including in designs that you intend to sell or sew out and sell.  There is no limitation on the number of designs or items you may sell.  For full details, check the LICENSE file in the top directory.

I've taken pains to make this font sew out nicely even though it's tiny.  Every character is properly underlayed using a center-walk stitch.  Even still, your choice of fabric, needle, and stabilizer will definitely affect your end results!  Make sure you test it out before sewing onto a garment or anything else that you really care about.

If you can see areas for improvement, I'd like to know.  Just open a github issue in this repo and we can talk through your ideas.

File Structure
--------------

This font is designed for Ink/Stitch and uses its standard font folder layout.  The folder contains four files:

* `→.svg` contains glyphs designed for words laid out horizontally and stitched left-to-right 
* `←.svg` contains glyphs designed for words laid out horizontally and stitched right-to-left
* `↓.svg` contains glyphs designed for words laid out vertically and stitched top-to-bottom
* `↑.svg` contains glyphs designed for words laid out vertically and stitched bottom-to-top

The files are named as they are so as to (hopefully) be recognizable to native speakers of multiple languages.
